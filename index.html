  <h3><strong>My Bio:</strong></h3>
  <p> In 2015 I left my job to follow my passion and pursue a career in Information Technology sector in web based technologies. I have completed my <Strong>Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology at CTI/Pearsons with Cum Laude</strong>
    and I am looking forward to rejoining the workforce doing something that I truly love doing. The reason I choose this field of study is that programming in web development is a usable art that makes a difference in people’s lives regardless if
    they realize it or not. Another reason programming/development is appealing to me is for the reason that it challenges your mind and the teams minds to come up with creative and simple solutions that opens up new possibilities to create new
    websites that could benefit all. Web based technologies appeals to me for the simple reason that I want to know how the mechanics of a website, the stucture, the flow and backend (database) of a website inorder to produce results and profit from
    the website itself. I have worked for another company (Steinhoff-Timbercity) for 8 to 9 years in a retail environment and one morning as I drank my coffee, I realized that this is not were my hart truly lies. So I looked at my hobbies and
    passions and realized that I should make a career change that suites my passion, because if you do something that love, you’ll never work a day in your live. The simple fact is that I am always willing to learn new things and age does not imply
    that you as a person are too old to learn and adapt.</p>
